        <span id="hix00076" class="sentence"> One afternoon,</span>

        <span id="hix00076s4" class="sentence"> the  family’s maid – who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet  – standing in his bedroom,</span>
        <span id="hix00076s5" class="sentence"> pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing  them in four large wooden crates,</span>
        <span id="hix00076s6" class="sentence"> even the things he’d hidden at the back that belonged  to him and were nobody else’s business.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00077" class="sentence"> ‘What are you doing?’ he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster,</span>

        <span id="hix00077s3" class="sentence"> his mother  had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the  way Father spoke to her.</span>
        <span id="hix00077s4" class="sentence"> ‘You take your hands off my things.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00078" class="sentence"> Maria shook,</span>

        <span id="hix00078s3" class="sentence"> where Bruno’s  mother had just appeared.</span>
        <span id="hix00078s4" class="sentence"> She was a tall woman with long red hair that she bundled  into a sort of net behind her head,</span>
        <span id="hix00078s5" class="sentence"> and she was twisting her hands together nervously  as if there was something she didn’t want to have to say or something she didn’t want  to have to believe.</span>

        <span id="hix00079" class="sentence"> ‘Mother,’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00079s2" class="sentence"> marching towards her,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00080" class="sentence"> ‘She’s packing them,’ explained Mother.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00081" class="sentence"> ‘Packing them?’ he asked,</span>
        <span id="hix00081s2" class="sentence"> running quickly through the events of the previous few days  to consider whether he’d been particularly naughty or had used those words out loud  that he wasn’t allowed to use and was being sent away because of it.</span>
        <span id="hix00081s3" class="sentence"> He couldn’t think  of anything though.</span>
        <span id="hix00081s4" class="sentence"> In fact over the last few days he had behaved in a perfectly decent  manner to everyone and couldn’t remember causing any chaos at all.</span>
        <span id="hix00081s5" class="sentence"> ‘Why?’ he asked  then.</span>
        <span id="hix00081s6" class="sentence"> ‘What have I done?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00082" class="sentence"> Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars,</span>
        <span id="hix00082s2" class="sentence"> the butler,</span>
        <span id="hix00082s3" class="sentence"> was in there,</span>
        <span id="hix00082s4" class="sentence"> packing her things too.</span>
        <span id="hix00082s5" class="sentence"> She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before  marching back to the staircase,</span>
        <span id="hix00082s6" class="sentence"> followed by Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00082s7" class="sentence"> who wasn’t going to let the matter  drop without an explanation.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00083" class="sentence"> ‘Mother,’ he insisted.</span>
        <span id="hix00083s2" class="sentence"> ‘What’s going on?</span>
        <span id="hix00083s3" class="sentence"> Are we moving?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00084" class="sentence"> ‘Come downstairs with me,’ said Mother,</span>
        <span id="hix00084s2" class="sentence"> leading the way towards the large dining room  where the Fury had been to dinner the week before.</span>
        <span id="hix00084s3" class="sentence"> ‘We’ll talk down there.’</span>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00085" class="sentence"> Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting  in the dining room when she arrived.</span>
        <span id="hix00085s2" class="sentence"> He looked at her without saying anything for  a moment and thought to himself that she couldn’t have applied her make-up correctly  that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual,</span>
        <span id="hix00085s3" class="sentence"> like his own after  he’d been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00086" class="sentence"> ‘Now,</span>
        <span id="hix00086s2" class="sentence"> you don’t have to worry,</span>
        <span id="hix00086s3" class="sentence"> Bruno,’ said Mother,</span>
        <span id="hix00086s4" class="sentence"> sitting down in the chair where  the beautiful blonde woman who had come to dinner with the Fury had sat and waved  at him when Father closed the doors.</span>
        <span id="hix00086s5" class="sentence"> ‘In fact if anything it’s going to be a great  adventure.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00087" class="sentence"> ‘What is?’ he asked.</span>
        <span id="hix00087s2" class="sentence"> ‘Am I being sent away?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00088" class="sentence"> ‘No,</span>
        <span id="hix00088s2" class="sentence"> not just you,’ she said,</span>
        <span id="hix00088s3" class="sentence"> looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking  better of it.</span>
        <span id="hix00088s4" class="sentence"> ‘We all are.</span>
        <span id="hix00088s5" class="sentence"> Your father and I,</span>
        <span id="hix00088s6" class="sentence"> Gretel and you.</span>
        <span id="hix00088s7" class="sentence"> All four of us.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00089" class="sentence"> Bruno thought about this and frowned.</span>
        <span id="hix00089s2" class="sentence"> He wasn’t particularly bothered if Gretel was  being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for  him.</span>
        <span id="hix00089s3" class="sentence"> But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00090" class="sentence"> ‘But where?’ he asked.</span>
        <span id="hix00090s2" class="sentence"> ‘Where are we going exactly?</span>
        <span id="hix00090s3" class="sentence"> Why can’t we stay here?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00091" class="sentence"> ‘Your father’s job,’ explained Mother.</span>
        <span id="hix00091s2" class="sentence"> ‘You know how important it is,</span>
        <span id="hix00091s3" class="sentence"> don’t you?’</span>
      </p>
      <p id="Page_4" class="page-normal">

        <span id="hix00092" class="sentence"> ‘Yes,</span>
        <span id="hix00092s2" class="sentence"> of course,’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00092s3" class="sentence"> nodding his head,</span>
        <span id="hix00092s4" class="sentence"> because there were always so many  visitors to the house – men in fantastic uniforms,</span>
        <span id="hix00092s5" class="sentence"> women with typewriters that he  had to keep his mucky hands off -and they were always very polite to Father and told  each other that he was a man to watch and that the Fury had big things in mind for  him.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00093" class="sentence"> ‘Well,</span>
        <span id="hix00093s2" class="sentence"> sometimes when someone is very important,’ continued Mother,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00094" class="sentence"> ‘What kind of job?’ asked Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00094s2" class="sentence"> because if he was honest with himself – which he  always tried to be – he wasn’t entirely sure what job Father did.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00095" class="sentence"> In school they had talked about their fathers one day and Karl had said that his father  was a greengrocer,</span>
        <span id="hix00095s2" class="sentence"> which Bruno knew to be true because he ran the greengrocer’s shop  in the centre of town.</span>
        <span id="hix00095s3" class="sentence"> And Daniel had said that his father was a teacher,</span>
        <span id="hix00095s4" class="sentence"> which Bruno  knew to be true because he taught the big boys who it was always wise to steer clear  of.</span>
        <span id="hix00095s5" class="sentence"> And Martin had said that his father was a chef,</span>
        <span id="hix00095s6" class="sentence"> which Bruno knew to be true because  he sometimes collected Martin from school and when he did he always wore a white smock  and a tartan apron,</span>
        <span id="hix00095s7" class="sentence"> as if he’d just stepped out of his kitchen.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00096" class="sentence"> But when they asked Bruno what his father did he opened his mouth to tell them,</span>
        <span id="hix00096s2" class="sentence"> then  realized that he didn’t know himself.</span>

        <span id="hix00141" class="sentence"> ‘I think this was a bad idea,’ said Bruno a few hours after they arrived,</span>

        <span id="hix00157" class="sentence"> ‘Mother sent me to help,’ he said quietly,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix00159" class="sentence"> Bruno sighed and opened the bag; it was full to the brim with his underwear and he  wanted nothing more than to crawl inside it and hope that when he climbed out again  he’d have woken up and be back home again.</span>

        <span id="hix00176s3" class="sentence"> He  walked slowly because he didn’t want to be disappointed.</span>
        <span id="hix00176s4" class="sentence"> But it was just a small boy’s  room and there was only so far he could walk before he arrived at the window.</span>

        <span id="hix00181s6" class="sentence"> All Gretel's unpleasant friends  seemed to enjoy nothing more than torturing him and said nasty things to him whenever  Mother or Maria were nowhere in sight.</span>

        <span id="hix00185" class="sentence"> This was true,</span>

        <span id="hix00185s3" class="sentence"> It was a source of constant  disappointment to him that he wasn’t as tall as any of the other boys in his class.</span>
        <span id="hix00185s4" class="sentence"> In fact he only came up to their shoulders.</span>

        <span id="hix00187s3" class="sentence"> even as long as a month,</span>

        <span id="hix00187s5" class="sentence"> It was something to  keep in mind anyway if he wanted to do what Mother had suggested and make the best  of a bad situation.</span>

        <span id="hix00225" class="sentence"> ‘There’s a forest over there,’ said Bruno,</span>

        <span id="hix00226" class="sentence"> ‘Bruno!’ snapped Gretel,</span>
        <span id="hix00226s2" class="sentence"> marching towards him so quickly that he jumped back from  the window and backed up against a wall.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00227" class="sentence"> ‘What?’ he asked,</span>
        <span id="hix00227s2" class="sentence"> pretending not to know what she was talking about.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00228" class="sentence"> ‘The other children,’ said Gretel.</span>
        <span id="hix00228s2" class="sentence"> ‘You said they don’t look at all friendly.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00229" class="sentence"> ‘Well,</span>
        <span id="hix00229s2" class="sentence"> they don’t,’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00229s3" class="sentence"> not wishing to judge them before he met them but going  by appearances,</span>
        <span id="hix00229s4" class="sentence"> which Mother had told him time and time again not to do.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00231" class="sentence"> Bruno smiled and walked towards the door,</span>
        <span id="hix00231s2" class="sentence"> indicating that Gretel should follow him.</span>
        <span id="hix00231s3" class="sentence"> She gave out a deep sigh as she did so,</span>
        <span id="hix00231s4" class="sentence"> stopping to put the doll on the bed but then  changing her mind and picking it up and holding it close to her chest as she went  into her brother’s room,</span>

        <span id="hix00232" class="sentence"> ‘They’re out there,’ said Bruno,</span>

        <span id="hix00232s3" class="sentence"> He didn’t turn back to check that Gretel was in the room; he was  too busy watching the children.</span>
        <span id="hix00232s4" class="sentence"> For a few moments he forgot that she was even there.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00233" class="sentence"> Gretel was still a few feet away and desperately wanted to look for herself,</span>
        <span id="hix00233s2" class="sentence"> but something  about the way he had said it and something about the way he was watching made her  feel suddenly nervous.</span>

        <span id="hix00233s4" class="sentence"> but there was something about  the way he stood there that made her feel as if she wasn’t sure she wanted to see  these children at all.</span>
        <span id="hix00233s5" class="sentence"> She swallowed nervously and said a silent prayer that they  would indeed be returning to Berlin in the foreseeable future and not in a month as  Bruno had suggested.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00238" class="sentence"> ‘Who are they?’ asked Gretel,</span>
        <span id="hix00238s2" class="sentence"> as open-mouthed as her brother often was these days.</span>
        <span id="hix00238s3" class="sentence"> ‘What sort of place is this?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00239" class="sentence"> ‘I’m not sure,’ said Bruno,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00241" class="sentence"> ‘Perhaps they live in a different part,’ suggested Bruno.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00242" class="sentence"> Gretel agreed.</span>
        <span id="hix00242s2" class="sentence"> She didn’t want to go on staring but it was very difficult to turn  her eyes away.</span>
        <span id="hix00242s3" class="sentence"> So far,</span>
        <span id="hix00242s4" class="sentence"> all she had seen was the forest facing her own window,</span>
        <span id="hix00242s5" class="sentence"> which  looked a little dark but a good place for picnics if there was any sort of clearing  further along it.</span>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00243" class="sentence"> But from this side of the house the view was very different.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00244" class="sentence"> It started off nicely enough.</span>
        <span id="hix00244s2" class="sentence"> There was a garden directly beneath Bruno’s window.</span>
        <span id="hix00244s3" class="sentence"> Quite a large one too,</span>
        <span id="hix00244s4" class="sentence"> and full of flowers which grew in neat orderly sections in  soil that looked as if it was tended very carefully by someone who knew that growing  flowers in a place like this was something good that they could do,</span>
        <span id="hix00244s5" class="sentence"> like putting a  tiny candle of light in the corner of a huge castle on a misty moor on a dark winter’s  night.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00245" class="sentence"> Past the flowers there was a very pleasant pavement with a wooden bench on it,</span>
        <span id="hix00245s2" class="sentence"> where  Gretel could imagine sitting in the sunshine and reading a book.</span>
        <span id="hix00245s3" class="sentence"> There was a plaque  attached to the top of the bench but she couldn’t read the inscription from this distance.</span>
        <span id="hix00245s4" class="sentence"> The seat was turned to face the house -which,</span>
        <span id="hix00245s5" class="sentence"> usually,</span>
        <span id="hix00245s6" class="sentence"> would be a strange thing to  do but on this occasion she could understand why.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00246" class="sentence"> About twenty feet further along from the garden and the flowers and the bench with  the plaque on it,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s2" class="sentence"> everything changed.</span>
        <span id="hix00246s3" class="sentence"> There was a huge wire fence that ran along the  length of the house and turned in at the top,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s4" class="sentence"> extending further along in either direction,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s5" class="sentence"> further than she could possibly see.</span>
        <span id="hix00246s6" class="sentence"> The fence was very high,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s7" class="sentence"> higher even than the  house they were standing in,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s8" class="sentence"> and there were huge wooden posts,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s9" class="sentence"> like telegraph poles,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s10" class="sentence"> dotted along it,</span>
        <span id="hix00246s11" class="sentence"> holding it up.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="Page_32" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s010.smil#Page_32">32</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00247" class="sentence"> At the top of the fence enormous bales of barbed wire were tangled in spirals,</span>
        <span id="hix00247s2" class="sentence"> and  Gretel felt an unexpected pain inside her as she looked at the sharp spikes sticking  out all the way round it.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00248" class="sentence"> There wasn’t any grass after the fence; in fact there was no greenery anywhere to  be seen in the distance.</span>
        <span id="hix00248s2" class="sentence"> Instead the ground was made of a sand-like substance,</span>
        <span id="hix00248s3" class="sentence"> and  as far as she could make out there was nothing but low huts and large square buildings  dotted around and one or two smoke stacks in the distance.</span>
        <span id="hix00248s4" class="sentence"> She opened her mouth to  say something,</span>
        <span id="hix00248s5" class="sentence"> but when she did she realized that she couldn’t find any words to express  her surprise,</span>
        <span id="hix00248s6" class="sentence"> and so she did the only sensible thing she could think of and closed  it again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00249" class="sentence"> ‘You see?’ said Bruno from the corner of the room,</span>
        <span id="hix00249s2" class="sentence"> feeling quietly pleased with himself  because whatever it was that was out there – and whoever <em>they</em> were -he had seen it first and he could see it whenever he wanted because they were  outside his bedroom window and not hers and therefore they belonged to him and he  was the king of everything they surveyed and she was his lowly subject.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00250" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t understand,’ said Gretel.</span>
        <span id="hix00250s2" class="sentence"> ‘Who would build such a nasty-looking place?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00251" class="sentence"> ‘It <em>is</em> a nasty-looking place,</span>
        <span id="hix00251s2" class="sentence"> isn’t it?’ agreed Bruno.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="Page_33" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s010.smil#Page_33">33</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00252" class="sentence"> ‘I think those huts have only one floor too.</span>
        <span id="hix00252s2" class="sentence"> Look how low they are.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00253" class="sentence"> ‘They must be modern types of houses,’ said Gretel.</span>
        <span id="hix00253s2" class="sentence"> ‘Father hates modern things.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00254" class="sentence"> ‘Then he won’t like them very much,’ said Bruno.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00255" class="sentence"> ‘No,’ replied Gretel.</span>
        <span id="hix00255s2" class="sentence"> She stood still for a long time staring at them.</span>
        <span id="hix00255s3" class="sentence"> She was twelve  years old and was considered to be one of the brightest girls in her class,</span>
        <span id="hix00255s4" class="sentence"> so she  squeezed her lips together and narrowed her eyes and forced her brain to understand  what she was looking at.</span>
        <span id="hix00255s5" class="sentence"> Finally she could think of only one explanation.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00256" class="sentence"> ‘This must be the countryside,’ said Gretel,</span>
        <span id="hix00256s2" class="sentence"> turning round to look at her brother  triumphantly.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00257" class="sentence"> ‘The countryside?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00258" class="sentence"> ‘Yes,</span>
        <span id="hix00258s2" class="sentence"> it’s the only explanation,</span>
        <span id="hix00258s3" class="sentence"> don’t you see?</span>
        <span id="hix00258s4" class="sentence"> When we’re at home,</span>
        <span id="hix00258s5" class="sentence"> in Berlin,</span>
        <span id="hix00258s6" class="sentence"> we’re  in the city.</span>
        <span id="hix00258s7" class="sentence"> That’s why there are so many people and so many houses and the schools  are full and you can’t make your way through the centre of town on a Saturday afternoon  without getting pushed from pillar to post.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00259" class="sentence"> ‘Yes...’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00259s2" class="sentence"> nodding his head,</span>
        <span id="hix00259s3" class="sentence"> trying to keep up.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00260" class="sentence"> ‘But we learned in geography class that in the countryside,</span>
        <span id="hix00260s2" class="sentence"> where all the farmers  are and the animals,</span>
        <span id="hix00260s3" class="sentence"> and they grow all the food,</span>
        <span id="hix00260s4" class="sentence"> there are huge areas like this where  people live and work and send all the food to feed us.’</span>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00261" class="sentence"> She looked out of the window again at the huge area spread out before her and the  distances that existed between each of the huts.</span>
        <span id="hix00261s2" class="sentence"> ‘This must be it.</span>
        <span id="hix00261s3" class="sentence"> It’s the countryside.</span>
        <span id="hix00261s4" class="sentence"> Perhaps this is our holiday home,’ she added hopefully.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00262" class="sentence"> Bruno thought about it and shook his head.</span>
        <span id="hix00262s2" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t think so,’ he said with great  conviction.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00263" class="sentence"> ‘You’re <em>nine,'</em> countered Gretel.</span>
        <span id="hix00263s2" class="sentence"> ‘How would you know?</span>
        <span id="hix00263s3" class="sentence"> When you get to my age you’ll understand these  things a lot better.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00264" class="sentence"> ‘That might be so,’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00264s2" class="sentence"> who knew that he was younger but didn’t agree that  that made him less likely to be right,</span>
        <span id="hix00264s3" class="sentence"> ‘but if this is the countryside like you say  it is,</span>
        <span id="hix00264s4" class="sentence"> then where are all the animals you’re talking about?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00265" class="sentence"> Gretel opened her mouth to answer him but couldn’t think of a suitable reply,</span>
        <span id="hix00265s2" class="sentence"> so she  looked out of the window again instead and peered around for them,</span>
        <span id="hix00265s3" class="sentence"> but they were nowhere  to be seen.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00266" class="sentence"> ‘There should be cows and pigs and sheep and horses,’ said Bruno.</span>
        <span id="hix00266s2" class="sentence"> ‘If it was a farm,</span>
        <span id="hix00266s3" class="sentence"> I mean.</span>
        <span id="hix00266s4" class="sentence"> Not to mention chickens and ducks.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00267" class="sentence"> ‘And there aren’t any,’ admitted Gretel quietly.</span>
        <span id="hix00267s2" class="sentence"> ‘And if they grew food here,</span>
        <span id="hix00267s3" class="sentence"> like  you suggested,’ continued Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix00267s4" class="sentence"> enjoying himself enormously,</span>
        <span id="hix00267s5" class="sentence"> ‘then I think the ground  would have to look a lot better than that,</span>
        <span id="hix00267s6" class="sentence"> don’t you?</span>

      <p>

        <span id="hix00318" class="sentence"> Back in Berlin,</span>
        <span id="hix00318s2" class="sentence"> Bruno had been inside Father’s office on only a handful of occasions,</span>

        <span id="hix00318s4" class="sentence"> However,</span>
        <span id="hix00318s5" class="sentence"> the rule that applied to Father’s office in Berlin was one of the most important  rules that Bruno had ever learned and he was not so silly as to think that it would  not apply here at Out-With too.</span>
        <span id="hix00318s6" class="sentence"> But since they had not seen each other in some days,</span>
        <span id="hix00318s7" class="sentence"> he thought that no one would mind if he knocked now.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00319" class="sentence"> And so he tapped carefully on the door.</span>
        <span id="hix00319s2" class="sentence"> Twice,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix00320" class="sentence"> Perhaps Father didn’t hear,</span>

        <span id="hix00464s2" class="sentence"> The rope was easy enough to find as there were bales of it in the  basement of the house and it didn’t take long to do something extremely dangerous  and find a sharp knife and cut as many lengths of it as he thought he might need.</span>
        <span id="hix00464s3" class="sentence"> He took these to the oak tree and left them on the ground for future use.</span>
        <span id="hix00464s4" class="sentence"> The tyre  was another matter.</span>

        <span id="hix00465s5" class="sentence"> and while he knew it would be impossible to  steal a tyre off any of them,</span>
        <span id="hix00465s6" class="sentence"> there was always the possibility that he could find  a spare one somewhere.</span>

        <span id="hix00466s3" class="sentence"> decided that he would be the sensible person to ask.</span>
        <span id="hix00466s4" class="sentence"> Lieutenant Kotler  was the young officer whom Bruno had seen on his very first day at Out-With,</span>
        <span id="hix00466s5" class="sentence"> the soldier  who had appeared upstairs in their house and looked at him for a moment before nodding  his head and continuing on his way.</span>

        <span id="hix00467s2" class="sentence"> Bruno wasn’t entirely sure why,</span>
        <span id="hix00467s3" class="sentence"> but he knew that  he didn’t like Lieutenant Kotler.</span>
        <span id="hix00467s4" class="sentence"> There was an atmosphere around him that made Bruno  feel very cold and want to put a jumper on.</span>
        <span id="hix00467s5" class="sentence"> Still,</span>
        <span id="hix00467s6" class="sentence"> there was no one else to ask so  he marched over with as much confidence as he could muster to say hello.</span>

        <span id="hix00468s3" class="sentence"> His black boots always  sparkled with polish and his yellow-blond hair was parted at the side and held perfectly  in place with something that made all the comb marks stand out in it,</span>

        <span id="hix00470s3" class="sentence"> Lieutenant Kotler  was deep in conversation with Gretel and whatever he was saying must have been terribly  funny because she was laughing loudly and twirling her hair around her fingers into  ringlets.</span>

        <span id="hix00471" class="sentence"> ‘Hello,’ said Bruno as he approached them,</span>

        <span id="hix00478s4" class="sentence"> Bruno stared at her  with distaste.</span>
        <span id="hix00478s5" class="sentence"> She was putting on a silly voice that made her sound as if she hadn’t  a thought in her head.</span>
        <span id="hix00478s6" class="sentence"> There was nothing Bruno wanted to do more than walk away from  the two of them and have nothing to do with whatever they were discussing,</span>

      <p>

        <span id="hix00500" class="sentence"> The accident took place a couple of hours later after Bruno had located a suitable  tyre and Pavel had dragged it to the large oak tree on Gretel’s side of the house,</span>
        <span id="hix00500s2" class="sentence"> and after Bruno had climbed up and down and up and down and up and down the trunk  to tie the ropes securely around the branches and the tyre itself.</span>
        <span id="hix00500s3" class="sentence"> Until then the  whole operation had been a tremendous success.</span>
        <span id="hix00500s4" class="sentence"> He had built one of these once before,</span>
        <span id="hix00500s5" class="sentence"> but back then he had had Karl and Daniel and Martin to help him with it.</span>
        <span id="hix00500s6" class="sentence"> On this occasion  he was doing it by himself and that made things decidedly trickier.</span>
        <span id="hix00500s7" class="sentence"> And yet somehow  he managed it,</span>
        <span id="hix00500s8" class="sentence"> and within a few hours he was happily installed inside the centre of  the tyre and swinging back and forth as if he did not have a care in the world,</span>
        <span id="hix00500s9" class="sentence"> although  he was ignoring the fact that it was one of the most uncomfortable swings he had ever  been on in his life.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00501" class="sentence"> He lay flat out across the centre of the tyre and used his feet to give himself a  good push off the ground.</span>
        <span id="hix00501s2" class="sentence"> Every time the tyre swung backwards it rose in the air and  narrowly avoided hitting the trunk of the tree itself,</span>
        <span id="hix00501s3" class="sentence"> but it still came close enough  for Bruno to use his feet to kick himself even faster and higher on the next swing.</span>

        <span id="hix00502" class="sentence"> This worked very well until his grip on the tyre slipped a little just as he kicked  the tree,</span>
        <span id="hix00502s2" class="sentence"> and before he knew it his body was turning inside and he fell downwards,</span>
        <span id="hix00502s3" class="sentence"> one foot still inside the rim while he landed face down on the ground beneath him  with a thud.</span>

        <span id="hix00503s2" class="sentence"> He sat up on the  ground just as the tyre swung back and hit him on the head and he let out a yelp and  moved out of its way.</span>
        <span id="hix00503s3" class="sentence"> When he stood up he could feel that his arm and leg were both  very sore as he had fallen heavily on them,</span>
        <span id="hix00503s4" class="sentence"> but they weren’t so sore that they might  be broken.</span>
        <span id="hix00503s5" class="sentence"> He inspected his hand and it was covered in scratches and when he looked  at his elbow he could see a nasty cut.</span>
        <span id="hix00503s6" class="sentence"> His leg felt worse though,</span>
        <span id="hix00503s7" class="sentence"> and when he looked  down at his knee,</span>
        <span id="hix00503s8" class="sentence"> just below where his shorts ended,</span>
        <span id="hix00503s9" class="sentence"> there was a wide gash which seemed  to have been waiting for him to look at it because once all the attention was focused  on it,</span>

        <span id="hix00504" class="sentence"> ‘Oh dear,’ said Bruno out loud,</span>

        <span id="hix00504s3" class="sentence"> He didn’t have to wonder for long though,</span>
        <span id="hix00504s4" class="sentence"> because the swing that he had built was  on the same side of the house as the kitchen,</span>
        <span id="hix00504s5" class="sentence"> and Pavel,</span>

        <span id="hix00505s2" class="sentence"> and only when  he arrived did he feel confident enough to let the woozy feeling that was surrounding  him take him over completely.</span>
        <span id="hix00505s3" class="sentence"> He fell a little but didn’t land on the ground this  time,</span>
        <span id="hix00505s4" class="sentence"> as Pavel scooped him up.</span>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00507" class="sentence"> ‘You were going too high,’ said Pavel in a quiet voice that immediately made Bruno  feel safe.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00510" class="sentence"> Pavel carried him across the lawn and back towards the house,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix00514" class="sentence"> Bruno watched as he moved around the kitchen,</span>

      </p>
      <p>

        <span id="hix00516" class="sentence"> ‘No,</span>
        <span id="hix00516s2" class="sentence"> no,’ said Pavel when he returned to his kneeling position,</span>
        <span id="hix00516s3" class="sentence"> dipping a dry cloth  into the bowl and touching it gently to Bruno’s knee,</span>
        <span id="hix00516s4" class="sentence"> which made him wince in pain,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00517" class="sentence"> Bruno frowned and bit his lip nervously as Pavel cleaned the wound of blood and then  held another cloth to it quite tightly for a few minutes.</span>
        <span id="hix00517s2" class="sentence"> When he pulled it away again,</span>
        <span id="hix00517s3" class="sentence"> gently,</span>
        <span id="hix00517s4" class="sentence"> the bleeding had stopped,</span>

        <span id="hix00517s6" class="sentence"> which stung quite sharply and made  Bruno say ‘Ow’ a few times in rapid succession.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00518" class="sentence"> ‘It’s not that bad,’ said Pavel,</span>

      </p>
      <p>

        <span id="hix00563s2" class="sentence"> They lived together in a small flat near the fruit and vegetable stalls,</span>
        <span id="hix00563s3" class="sentence"> and around  the time that Bruno moved to Out-With,</span>
        <span id="hix00563s4" class="sentence"> Grandfather was almost seventy-three years  old which,</span>
        <span id="hix00563s5" class="sentence"> as far as Bruno was concerned,</span>
        <span id="hix00563s6" class="sentence"> made him just about the oldest man in the  world.</span>
        <span id="hix00563s7" class="sentence"> One afternoon Bruno had calculated that if he lived his entire life over and  over again eight times,</span>
        <span id="hix00563s8" class="sentence"> he would still be a year younger than Grandfather.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00564" class="sentence"> Grandfather had spent his entire life running a restaurant in the centre of town,</span>
        <span id="hix00564s2" class="sentence"> and one of his employees was the father of Bruno’s friend Martin who worked there  as a chef.</span>
        <span id="hix00564s3" class="sentence"> Although Grandfather no longer cooked or waited on tables in the restaurant  himself,</span>
        <span id="hix00564s4" class="sentence"> he spent most of his days there,</span>
        <span id="hix00564s5" class="sentence"> sitting at the bar in the afternoon talking  to the customers,</span>
        <span id="hix00564s6" class="sentence"> eating his meals there in the evening and staying until closing  time,</span>

        <span id="hix00565" class="sentence"> Grandmother never seemed old in comparison to the other boys’ grandmothers.</span>
        <span id="hix00565s2" class="sentence"> In fact  when Bruno learned just how old she was – sixty-two – he was amazed.</span>
        <span id="hix00565s3" class="sentence"> She had met Grandfather  as a young woman after one of her concerts and somehow he had persuaded her to marry  him,</span>
        <span id="hix00565s4" class="sentence"> despite all his flaws.</span>
        <span id="hix00565s5" class="sentence"> She had long red hair,</span>
        <span id="hix00565s6" class="sentence"> surprisingly similar to her daughter-in-law’s,</span>
        <span id="hix00565s7" class="sentence"> and green eyes,</span>
        <span id="hix00565s8" class="sentence"> and she claimed that was because somewhere in her family there was  Irish blood.</span>
        <span id="hix00565s9" class="sentence"> Bruno always knew when a family party was getting into full swing because  Grandmother would hover by the piano until someone sat down at it and asked her to  sing.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00566" class="sentence"> ‘What’s that?’ she always cried,</span>
        <span id="hix00566s2" class="sentence"> holding a hand to her chest as if the very idea took  her breath away.</span>
        <span id="hix00566s3" class="sentence"> ‘Is it a song you’re wanting?</span>
        <span id="hix00566s4" class="sentence"> Why,</span>
        <span id="hix00566s5" class="sentence"> I couldn’t possibly.</span>

        <span id="hix00567" class="sentence"> ‘Sing!</span>
        <span id="hix00567s2" class="sentence"> Sing!’ everyone at the party would cry,</span>
        <span id="hix00567s3" class="sentence"> and after a suitable pause – sometimes  as long as ten or twelve seconds – she would finally give in and turn to the young  man at the piano and say in a quick and humorous voice:</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00569" class="sentence"> Parties at Bruno’s house were always dominated by Grandmother’s singing,</span>
        <span id="hix00569s2" class="sentence"> which for  some reason always seemed to coincide with the moment when Mother moved from the main  party area to the kitchen,</span>
        <span id="hix00569s3" class="sentence"> followed by some of her own friends.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00570" class="sentence"> Father always stayed to listen and Bruno did too because there was nothing he liked  more than hearing Grandmother break into her full voice and soak up the applause of  the guests at the end.</span>
        <span id="hix00570s2" class="sentence"> Plus,</span>
        <span id="hix00570s3" class="sentence">
          <em>La Vie en Rose</em> gave him chills and made the tiny hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00571" class="sentence"> Grandmother liked to think that Bruno or Gretel would follow her onto the stage,</span>
        <span id="hix00571s2" class="sentence"> and  every Christmas and at every birthday party she would devise a small play for the  three of them to perform for Mother,</span>
        <span id="hix00571s3" class="sentence"> Father and Grandfather.</span>
        <span id="hix00571s4" class="sentence"> She wrote the plays herself  and,</span>
        <span id="hix00571s5" class="sentence"> to Bruno’s way of thinking,</span>
        <span id="hix00571s6" class="sentence"> always gave herself the best lines,</span>
        <span id="hix00571s7" class="sentence"> though he didn’t  mind that too much.</span>
        <span id="hix00571s8" class="sentence"> There was usually a song in there somewhere too – <em>Is it a song you’re wanting</em>?</span>
        <span id="hix00571s9" class="sentence"> she’d ask first – and an opportunity for Bruno to do a magic trick and for Gretel  to dance.</span>
        <span id="hix00571s10" class="sentence"> The play always ended with Bruno reciting a long poem by one of the Great  Poets,</span>
        <span id="hix00571s11" class="sentence"> words which he found very hard to understand but which somehow started to sound  more and more beautiful the more he read them.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00572" class="sentence"> But that wasn’t the best part of these little productions.</span>
        <span id="hix00572s2" class="sentence"> The best part was the fact  that Grandmother made costumes for Bruno and Gretel.</span>
        <span id="hix00572s3" class="sentence"> No matter what the role,</span>
        <span id="hix00572s4" class="sentence"> no matter  how few lines he might have in comparison to his sister or grandmother,</span>
        <span id="hix00572s5" class="sentence"> Bruno always  got to dress up as a prince,</span>
        <span id="hix00572s6" class="sentence"> or an Arab sheik,</span>
        <span id="hix00572s7" class="sentence"> or even on one occasion a Roman gladiator.</span>

        <span id="hix00573s3" class="sentence"> And when there  weren’t spears there were whips or turbans.</span>
        <span id="hix00573s4" class="sentence"> No one ever knew what Grandmother would  come up with next,</span>
        <span id="hix00573s5" class="sentence"> but a week before Christmas Bruno and Gretel would be summoned  to her home on a daily basis for rehearsals.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00574" class="sentence"> Of course the last play they performed had ended in disaster and Bruno still remembered  it with sadness,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00575" class="sentence"> A week or so before,</span>
        <span id="hix00575s2" class="sentence"> there had been great excitement in the house and it had something  to do with the fact that Father was now to be addressed as ‘Commandant’ by Maria,</span>
        <span id="hix00575s3" class="sentence"> Cook and Lars the butler,</span>
        <span id="hix00575s4" class="sentence"> as well as by all the soldiers who came in and out of there  and used the place – as far as Bruno could see – as if it were their own and not his.</span>
        <span id="hix00575s5" class="sentence"> There had been nothing but excitement for weeks.</span>
        <span id="hix00575s6" class="sentence"> First the Fury and the beautiful  blonde woman had come to dinner,</span>

        <span id="hix00575s8" class="sentence"> and then it was this new business of calling Father ‘Commandant’.</span>
        <span id="hix00575s9" class="sentence"> Mother had told  Bruno to congratulate Father and he had done so,</span>
        <span id="hix00575s10" class="sentence"> although if he was honest with himself  (which he always tried to be) he wasn’t entirely sure what he was congratulating him  for.</span>

        <span id="hix00576s10" class="sentence"> Bruno was particularly  impressed by all the decorations on the uniform and he had been allowed to wear the  cap for a short period,</span>

        <span id="hix00634" class="sentence"> Sometimes – not very often,</span>

        <span id="hix00948" class="sentence"> Later that evening Bruno was disappointed to find that Lieutenant Kotler was joining  him,</span>
        <span id="hix00948s2" class="sentence"> Mother,</span>
        <span id="hix00948s3" class="sentence"> Father and Gretel for dinner.</span>
        <span id="hix00948s4" class="sentence"> Pavel was wearing his white jacket as usual  and served them as they ate.</span>

        <span id="hix00949" class="sentence"> Bruno watched Pavel as he went around the table and found that he felt sad whenever  he looked at him.</span>
        <span id="hix00949s2" class="sentence"> He wondered whether the white jacket he wore as a waiter was the  same as the white jacket he had worn before as a doctor.</span>
        <span id="hix00949s3" class="sentence"> As he brought the plates  in and set them down in front of each of them,</span>
        <span id="hix00949s4" class="sentence"> and while they ate their food and talked,</span>
        <span id="hix00949s5" class="sentence"> he stepped back towards the wall and held himself perfectly still,</span>
        <span id="hix00949s6" class="sentence"> neither looking  ahead nor not.</span>
        <span id="hix00949s7" class="sentence"> It was as if his body had gone to sleep standing up and with his eyes  open.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00950" class="sentence"> Whenever anyone needed anything,</span>
        <span id="hix00950s2" class="sentence"> Pavel would bring it immediately,</span>
        <span id="hix00950s3" class="sentence"> but the more Bruno  watched him the more he was sure that catastrophe was going to strike.</span>
        <span id="hix00950s4" class="sentence"> He seemed to  grow smaller and smaller each week,</span>
        <span id="hix00950s5" class="sentence"> if such a thing were possible,</span>
        <span id="hix00950s6" class="sentence"> and the colour  that should have been in his cheeks had drained almost entirely away.</span>
        <span id="hix00950s7" class="sentence"> His eyes appeared  heavy with tears and Bruno thought that one good blink might bring on a torrent.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix00951" class="sentence"> When Pavel came in with the plates,</span>
        <span id="hix00951s2" class="sentence"> Bruno couldn’t help but notice that his hands  were shaking slightly under the weight of them.</span>
        <span id="hix00951s3" class="sentence"> And when he stepped back to his usual  position he seemed to sway on his feet and had to press a hand against the wall to  steady himself.</span>
        <span id="hix00951s4" class="sentence"> Mother had to ask twice for her extra helping of soup before he heard  her,</span>
        <span id="hix00951s5" class="sentence"> and he let the bottle of wine empty without having opened another one in time  to fill Father’s glass.</span>

      </p>
      <p id="hix00952">‘Herr Liszt won’t let us read poetry or plays,’ complained Bruno during the main course.  As they had company for dinner, the family were dressed formally – Father in his uniform,  Mother in a green dress that set off her eyes, and Gretel and Bruno in the clothes  they wore to church when they lived in Berlin. ‘I asked him if we could read them  just one day a week but he said no, not while he was in charge of our education.’</p>
      <p id="hix00953">‘I’m sure he has his reasons,’ said Father, attacking a leg of lamb.</p>
      <p id="hix00954">‘All he wants us to do is study history and geography,’ said Bruno. ‘And I’m starting  to hate history and geography.’</p>
      <p id="hix00955">‘Don’t say hate, Bruno, please,’ said Mother.</p>
      <p id="hix00956">‘Why do you hate history?’ asked Father, laying down his fork for a moment and looking  across the table at his son, who shrugged his shoulders, a bad habit of his.</p>
      <p id="hix00957">‘Because it’s boring,’ he said.</p>
      <p id="hix00958">‘Boring?’ said Father. ‘A son of mine calling the study of history boring? Let me  tell you this, Bruno,’ he went on, leaning forward and pointing his knife at the boy,  ‘it’s history that’s got us here today. If it wasn’t for history, none of us would  be sitting around this table now. We’d be safely back at our table in our house in  Berlin.</p>
      <p id="Page_144" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s019.smil#Page_144">144</a>
      </p>
      <p id="hix00959">We are correcting history here.’</p>
      <p id="hix00960">‘It’s still boring,’ repeated Bruno, who wasn’t really paying attention.</p>
      <p id="hix00961">‘You’ll have to forgive my brother, Lieutenant Kotler,’ said Gretel, laying a hand  on his arm for a moment, which made Mother stare at her and narrow her eyes. ‘He’s  a very ignorant little boy.’</p>
      <p id="hix00962">‘I am not ignorant,’ snapped Bruno, who had had enough of her insults. ‘You’ll have  to forgive my sister, Lieutenant Kotler,’ he added politely, ‘but she’s a Hopeless  Case. There’s very little we can do for her. The doctors say she’s gone past the point  of help.’ ‘Shut up,’ said Gretel, blushing scarlet.</p>
      <p id="hix00963">‘You shut up,’ said Bruno with a broad smile. ‘Children, please,’ said Mother.</p>
      <p id="hix00964">Father tapped his knife on the table and everyone was silent. Bruno glanced in his  direction. He didn’t look angry exactly, but he did look as if he wasn’t going to  put up with much more arguing.</p>
      <p id="hix00965">‘I enjoyed history very much when I was a boy,’ said Lieutenant Kotler after a few  silent moments. ‘And although my father was a professor of literature at the university,  I preferred the social sciences to the arts.’</p>
      <p id="hix00966">‘I didn’t know that, Kurt,’ said Mother, turning to look at him for a moment. ‘Does  he still teach then?’ ‘I suppose so,’ said Lieutenant Kotler. ‘I don’t really know.’</p>
      <p id="Page_145" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s019.smil#Page_145">145</a>
      </p>
      <p id="hix00967">‘Well, how could you not know?’ she asked, frowning at him. ‘Don’t you keep in touch  with him?’</p>
      <p id="hix00968">The young lieutenant chewed on a mouthful of lamb and it gave him an opportunity to  think of a reply. He looked to Bruno as if he regretted having brought the matter  up in the first place.</p>
      <p id="hix00969">‘Kurt,’ repeated Mother, ‘don’t you keep in touch with your father?’</p>
      <p id="hix00970">‘Not really,’ he replied, shrugging his shoulders dismissively and not turning his  head to look at her. ‘He left Germany some years ago. Nineteen thirty-eight, I think  it was. I haven’t seen him since then.’ Father stopped eating for a moment and stared  across at Lieutenant Kotler, frowning slightly. ‘And where did he go?’ he asked.</p>
      <p id="hix00971">‘I beg your pardon, Herr Commandant?’ asked Lieutenant Kotler, even though Father  had spoken in a perfectly clear voice.</p>
      <p id="hix00972">‘I asked you where he went,’ he repeated. ‘Your father. The professor of literature.  Where did he go when he left Germany?’</p>
      <p id="hix00973">Lieutenant Kotler’s face grew a little red and he stuttered somewhat as he spoke.  ‘I believe... I believe he is currently in Switzerland,’ he said finally. ‘The last  I heard he was teaching at a university in Berne.’</p>
      <p id="hix00974">‘Oh, but Switzerland’s a beautiful country,’ said Mother quickly.</p>
      <p id="Page_146" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s019.smil#Page_146">146</a>
      </p>
      <p id="hix00975">‘I haven’t ever been there, I admit, but from what I hear–’</p>
      <p id="hix00976">‘He can’t be very old, your father,’ said Father, his deep voice silencing them all.  ‘I mean you’re only... what? Seventeen? Eighteen years old?’</p>
      <p id="hix00977">‘Fve just turned nineteen, Herr Commandant.’</p>
      <p id="hix00978">‘So your father would be... in his forties, I expect?’</p>
      <p id="hix00979">Lieutenant Kotler said nothing but continued to eat although he didn’t appear to be  enjoying his food at all.</p>
      <p id="hix00980">‘Strange that he chose not to stay in the Fatherland,’ said Father.</p>
      <p id="hix00981">‘We’re not close, my father and I,’ said Lieutenant Kotler quickly, looking around  the table as if he owed everyone an explanation. ‘Really, we haven’t spoken in years.’</p>
      <p id="hix00982">‘And what reason did he give, might I ask,’ continued Father, ‘for leaving Germany  at the moment of her greatest glory and her most vital need, when it is incumbent  upon all of us to play our part in the national revival? Was he tubercular?’</p>
      <p id="hix00983">Lieutenant Kotler stared at Father, confused. ‘I beg your pardon?’ he asked.</p>
      <p id="hix00984">‘Did he go to Switzerland to take the air?’ explained Father. ‘Or did he have a particular  reason for leaving Germany? In nineteen thirty-eight,’ he added after a moment.</p>
      <p id="Page_147" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s019.smil#Page_147">147</a>
      </p>
      <p id="hix00985">‘I’m afraid I don’t know, Herr Commandant,’ said Lieutenant Kotler. ‘You would have  to ask him.’ ‘Well, that would be rather difficult to do, wouldn’t it? With him being  so far away, I mean. But perhaps that was it. Perhaps he was ill.’ Father hesitated  before picking up his knife and fork again and continuing to eat. ‘Or perhaps he had...  disagreements.’</p>
      <p id="hix00986">‘Disagreements, Herr Commandant?’</p>
      <p id="hix00987">‘With government policy. One hears tales of men like this from time to time. Curious  fellows, I imagine. Disturbed, some of them. Traitors, others. Cowards too. Of course  you have informed your superiors of your father’s views, Lieutenant Kotler?’ The young  lieutenant opened his mouth and then swallowed, despite the fact that he hadn’t been  eating anything.</p>
      <p id="hix00988">‘Never mind,’ said Father cheerfully. ‘Perhaps it is not an appropriate subject of  conversation for the dinner table. We can discuss it in more depth at a later time.’</p>
      <p id="hix00989">‘Herr Commandant,’ said Lieutenant Kotler, leaning forward anxiously, ‘I can assure  you–’</p>
      <p id="hix00990">‘It is <em>not</em> an appropriate subject of conversation for the dinner table,’ repeated Father sharply,  silencing him immediately, and Bruno looked from one to the other, both enjoying and  being frightened by the atmosphere at the same time.</p>
      <p id="Page_148" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s019.smil#Page_148">148</a>
      </p>
      <p id="hix00991">‘I’d love to go to Switzerland,’ said Gretel after a lengthy silence.</p>
      <p id="hix00992">‘Eat your dinner, Gretel,’ said Mother.</p>
      <p id="hix00993">‘But I was just saying!’</p>
      <p id="hix00994">‘Eat your dinner,’ Mother repeated and was about to say more but she was interrupted  by Father calling for Pavel again.</p>
      <p id="hix00995">‘What’s the matter with you tonight?’ he asked as Pavel uncorked the new bottle. ‘This  is the fourth time I’ve had to ask for more wine.’</p>
      <p id="hix00996">Bruno watched him, hoping he was feeling all right, although he managed to release  the cork without any accidents. But after he had filled Father’s glass and turned  to refill Lieutenant Kotler’s, he lost his grip of the bottle somehow and it fell  crashing, glug-glug-glugging its contents out directly onto the young man’s lap.</p>
      <p id="hix00997">What happened then was both unexpected and extremely unpleasant. Lieutenant Kotler  grew very angry with Pavel and no one – not Bruno, not Gretel, not Mother and not  even Father – stepped in to stop him doing what he did next, even though none of them  could watch. Even though it made Bruno cry and Gretel grow pale.</p>
      <p id="hix00998">Later that night, when Bruno went to bed, he thought about all that had happened over  dinner. He remembered how kind Pavel had been to him on the afternoon he had made  the swing, and how he had stopped his knee from bleeding and been very gentle in the  way he administered the green ointment.</p>
      <p id="Page_149" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s019.smil#Page_149">149</a>
      </p>
      <p id="hix00999">And while Bruno realized that Father was generally a very kind and thoughtful man,  it hardly seemed fair or right that no one had stopped Lieutenant Kotler getting so  angry at Pavel, and if that was the kind of thing that went on at Out-With then he’d  better not disagree with anyone any more about anything; in fact he would do well  to keep his mouth shut and cause no chaos at all. Some people might not like it.</p>
      <p id="hix01000">His old life in Berlin seemed like a very distant memory now and he could hardly even  remember what Karl, Daniel or Martin looked like, except for the fact that one of  them was a ginger.</p>

        <span id="hix01005s4" class="sentence"> How can anyone live in so small a space as that?’ He’d forgotten  Shmuel’s story about the eleven people all living in the same room together before  they had come to Out-With,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01010" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t even like stripes,’ said Bruno,</span>

        <span id="hix01010s3" class="sentence"> In fact  he did like stripes and he felt increasingly fed up that he had to wear trousers and  shirts and ties and shoes that were too tight for him when Shmuel and his friends  got to wear striped pyjamas all day long.</span>

        <span id="hix01075" class="sentence"> For several weeks the rain was on and off and on and off and Bruno and Shmuel did  not see as much of each other as they would have liked.</span>
        <span id="hix01075s2" class="sentence"> When they did meet Bruno found  that he was starting to worry about his friend because he seemed to be getting even  thinner by the day and his face was growing more and more grey.</span>
        <span id="hix01075s3" class="sentence"> Sometimes he brought  more bread and cheese with him to give to Shmuel,</span>
        <span id="hix01075s4" class="sentence"> and from time to time he even managed  to hide a piece of chocolate cake in his pocket,</span>
        <span id="hix01075s5" class="sentence"> but the walk from the house to the  place in the fence where the two boys met was a long one and sometimes Bruno got hungry  on the way and found that one bite of the cake would lead to another,</span>
        <span id="hix01075s6" class="sentence"> and that in  turn led to another,</span>
        <span id="hix01075s7" class="sentence"> and by the time there was only one mouthful left he knew it would  be wrong to give that to Shmuel because it would only tease his appetite and not satisfy  it.</span>

        <span id="hix01076" class="sentence"> Father’s birthday was coming up soon,</span>

        <span id="hix01076s3" class="sentence"> Mother arranged a party for all the officers serving at Out-With and a great fuss  was made to prepare for it.</span>

        <span id="hix01077s2" class="sentence"> Lieutenant Kotler was there  beside her to help,</span>
        <span id="hix01077s3" class="sentence"> and between them they seemed to make more lists than could ever  possibly be needed.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01078" class="sentence"> Bruno decided to make a list of his own.</span>
        <span id="hix01078s2" class="sentence"> A list of all the reasons why he didn’t like  Lieutenant Kotler.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01079" class="sentence"> There was the fact that he never smiled and always looked as if he was trying to find  somebody to cut out of his will.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01080" class="sentence"> On the rare occasions when he spoke to Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01080s2" class="sentence"> he addressed him as ‘little man’,</span>
        <span id="hix01080s3" class="sentence"> which  was just plain nasty because,</span>
        <span id="hix01080s4" class="sentence"> as Mother pointed out,</span>
        <span id="hix01080s5" class="sentence"> he just hadn’t had his growth  spurt yet.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01081" class="sentence"> Not to mention the fact that he was always in the living room with Mother and making  jokes with her,</span>
        <span id="hix01081s2" class="sentence"> and Mother laughed at his jokes more than she laughed at Father’s.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01082" class="sentence"> Once when Bruno was watching the camp from his bedroom window he saw a dog approach  the fence and start barking loudly,</span>
        <span id="hix01082s2" class="sentence"> and when Lieutenant Kotler heard it he marched  right over to the dog and shot it.</span>
        <span id="hix01082s3" class="sentence"> Then there was all that nonsense that Gretel came  out with whenever he was around.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01083" class="sentence"> And Bruno still hadn’t forgotten the evening with Pavel,</span>
        <span id="hix01083s2" class="sentence"> the waiter who was really  a doctor,</span>
        <span id="hix01083s3" class="sentence"> and how angry the young lieutenant had been.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01084" class="sentence"> Also,</span>
        <span id="hix01084s2" class="sentence"> whenever Father was called away to Berlin on an overnight trip the lieutenant  hung around the house as if he were in charge: he would be there when Bruno was going  to bed and be back again in the morning before he even woke up.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01085" class="sentence"> There were a lot more reasons why Bruno didn’t like Lieutenant Kotler,</span>
        <span id="hix01085s2" class="sentence"> but these were  the first things that came into his mind.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01086" class="sentence"> On the afternoon before the birthday party Bruno was in his room with the door open  when he heard Lieutenant Kotler arriving at the house and speaking to someone,</span>
        <span id="hix01086s2" class="sentence"> although  he couldn’t hear anyone answering back.</span>
        <span id="hix01086s3" class="sentence"> A few minutes later,</span>
        <span id="hix01086s4" class="sentence"> as he was coming downstairs,</span>
        <span id="hix01086s5" class="sentence"> he heard Mother giving instructions about what needed to be done and Lieutenant Kotler  saying,</span>
        <span id="hix01086s6" class="sentence"> ‘Don’t worry,</span>
        <span id="hix01086s7" class="sentence"> this one knows which side his bread is buttered on,’ and then  laughing in a nasty way.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01087" class="sentence"> Bruno walked towards the living room with a new book Father had given him called <em>Treasure Island,</em></span>
        <span id="hix01087s2" class="sentence">
          <em></em>intending to sit in there for an hour or two while he read it,</span>
        <span id="hix01087s3" class="sentence"> but as he walked through  the hallway he ran into Lieutenant Kotler,</span>
        <span id="hix01087s4" class="sentence"> who was just leaving the kitchen.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01088" class="sentence"> ‘Hello,</span>
        <span id="hix01088s2" class="sentence"> little man,’ the soldier said,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01089" class="sentence"> ‘Hello,’ said Bruno,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01091" class="sentence"> Bruno stared at him and started thinking of seven more reasons to dislike him.</span>
        <span id="hix01091s2" class="sentence"> ‘I’m  going in there to read my book,’ he said,</span>
        <span id="hix01091s3" class="sentence"> pointing towards the living room.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01092" class="sentence"> Without a word Kotler whipped the book out of Bruno’s hands and started to flick through  it.</span>
        <span id="hix01092s2" class="sentence">
          <em>‘Treasure Island,’</em> he said.</span>
        <span id="hix01092s3" class="sentence"> ‘What’s it about then?’</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01093" class="sentence"> ‘Well,</span>
        <span id="hix01093s2" class="sentence"> there’s an island,’ said Bruno slowly,</span>

        <span id="hix01093s4" class="sentence"> ‘And there’s treasure on it.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01094" class="sentence"> ‘I could have guessed that,’ said Kotler,</span>
        <span id="hix01094s2" class="sentence"> looking at him as if there were things he  would do to the boy if he were a son of his and not the son of the Commandant.</span>
        <span id="hix01094s3" class="sentence"> ‘Tell  me something I don’t know about it.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01095" class="sentence"> ‘There’s a pirate in it,’ said Bruno.</span>
        <span id="hix01095s2" class="sentence"> ‘Called Long John Silver.</span>
        <span id="hix01095s3" class="sentence"> And a boy called Jim  Hawkins.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01096" class="sentence"> ‘An English boy?’ asked Kotler.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01097" class="sentence"> ‘Yes,’ said Bruno.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01098" class="sentence"> ‘Grunt,’ grunted Kotler.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01099" class="sentence"> Bruno stared at him and wondered how long it would be before he gave back his book.</span>
        <span id="hix01099s2" class="sentence"> He didn’t seem particularly interested in it,</span>
        <span id="hix01099s3" class="sentence"> but when Bruno reached for it he pulled  it away.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01100" class="sentence"> ‘Sorry,’ he said,</span>
        <span id="hix01100s2" class="sentence"> holding it out again,</span>

        <span id="hix01100s4" class="sentence"> ‘Oh,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01102" class="sentence"> Bruno tried to step past him,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01105" class="sentence"> ‘There’ll be a lot of people here,’ said Lieutenant Kotler,</span>
        <span id="hix01105s2" class="sentence"> breathing in heavily and  looking around as if this were his house and not Bruno’s.</span>

        <span id="hix01107s3" class="sentence"> A ball of anger exploded inside him and made him wish that he had the courage to say  exactly what he wanted to say.</span>
        <span id="hix01107s4" class="sentence"> It was one thing,</span>

        <span id="hix01107s6" class="sentence"> to be told what to do  by Mother and Father – that was perfectly reasonable and to be expected – but it was  another thing entirely to be told what to do by someone else.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01116" class="sentence"> ‘What are you doing here?’ repeated Bruno,</span>

        <span id="hix01121" class="sentence"> ‘I’d never noticed before,’ he said in a disbelieving voice,</span>

        <span id="hix01126" class="sentence"> Bruno frowned.</span>
        <span id="hix01126s2" class="sentence"> He thought about the people in their striped pyjamas and wondered what  was going on at Out-With and whether it wasn’t a very bad idea if it made people look  so unhealthy.</span>

        <span id="hix01126s8" class="sentence"> and Bruno’s eyes sparkled in delight for there were very few things in life that he  enjoyed more than cold chicken with sage and onion stuffing.</span>
        <span id="hix01126s9" class="sentence"> He took a knife from  the drawer and cut himself a few healthy slices and coated them with the stuffing  before turning back to his friend.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01127" class="sentence"> I m very glad you’re here,’ he said,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01129" class="sentence"> I wouldn’t mind him,’ said Bruno,</span>

        <span id="hix01170s2" class="sentence"> running towards him and sitting down,</span>
        <span id="hix01170s3" class="sentence"> almost crying with relief  and regret.</span>
        <span id="hix01170s4" class="sentence"> ‘I’m so sorry,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01171" class="sentence"> ‘It’s all right,’ said Shmuel,</span>
        <span id="hix01171s2" class="sentence"> looking up at him now.</span>
        <span id="hix01171s3" class="sentence"> There was a lot of bruising  on his face and Bruno grimaced,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01172" class="sentence"> ‘What happened to you?’ he asked and then didn’t wait for an answer.</span>
        <span id="hix01172s2" class="sentence"> ‘Was it your  bicycle?</span>
        <span id="hix01172s3" class="sentence"> Because that happened to me back in Berlin a couple of years ago.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01174" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t feel it any more,’ said Shmuel.</span>

        <span id="hix01177s6" class="sentence"> He felt that he should say it one last time and really mean it.</span>
        <span id="hix01177s7" class="sentence"> 'I’m  very sorry,</span>
        <span id="hix01177s8" class="sentence"> Shmuel,’ he said in a clear voice.</span>

        <span id="hix01178s6" class="sentence"> waiting until Bruno did the same,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01180" class="sentence"> It had been almost a year since Bruno had come home to find Maria packing his things,</span>
        <span id="hix01180s2" class="sentence"> and his memories of life in Berlin had almost all faded away.</span>
        <span id="hix01180s3" class="sentence"> When he thought back  he could remember that Karl and Martin were two of his three best friends for life,</span>
        <span id="hix01180s4" class="sentence"> but try as he might he couldn’t remember who the other one was.</span>
        <span id="hix01180s5" class="sentence"> And then something  happened that meant that for two days he could leave Out-With and return to his old  house: Grandmother had died and the family had to go home for the funeral.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01181" class="sentence"> While he was there,</span>
        <span id="hix01181s2" class="sentence"> Bruno realized he wasn’t quite as small as he had been when he  left because he could see over things that he couldn’t see over before,</span>
        <span id="hix01181s3" class="sentence"> and when they  stayed in their old house he could look through the window on the top floor and see  across Berlin without having to stand on tiptoes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01182" class="sentence"> Bruno hadn’t seen his grandmother since leaving Berlin but he had thought about her  every day.</span>
        <span id="hix01182s2" class="sentence"> The things he remembered most about her were the productions that she and  he and Gretel performed at Christmas and birthdays and how she always had the perfect  costume to suit whatever role he played.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01183" class="sentence"> When he thought that they would never be able to do that again it made him very sad  indeed.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01184" class="sentence"> The two days they spent in Berlin were also very sad ones.</span>
        <span id="hix01184s2" class="sentence"> There was the funeral,</span>
        <span id="hix01184s3" class="sentence"> and Bruno and Gretel and Father and Mother and Grandfather sat in the front row,</span>
        <span id="hix01184s4" class="sentence"> Father  wearing his most impressive uniform,</span>
        <span id="hix01184s5" class="sentence"> the starched and pressed one with the decorations.</span>
        <span id="hix01184s6" class="sentence"> Father was particularly sad,</span>
        <span id="hix01184s7" class="sentence"> Mother told Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01184s8" class="sentence"> because he had fought with Grandmother  and they hadn’t made it up before she died.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01185" class="sentence"> There were a lot of wreaths delivered to the church and Father was proud of the fact  that one of them had been sent by the Fury,</span>
        <span id="hix01185s2" class="sentence"> but when Mother heard she said that Grandmother  would turn in her grave if she knew it was there.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01186" class="sentence"> Bruno felt almost glad when they returned to Out-With.</span>
        <span id="hix01186s2" class="sentence"> The house there had become  his home now and he’d stopped worrying about the fact that it had only three floors  rather than five,</span>
        <span id="hix01186s3" class="sentence"> and it didn’t bother him so much that the soldiers came and went  as if they owned the place.</span>
        <span id="hix01186s4" class="sentence"> It slowly dawned on him that things weren’t too bad there  after all,</span>
        <span id="hix01186s5" class="sentence"> especially since he’d met Shmuel.</span>
        <span id="hix01186s6" class="sentence"> He knew that there were many things he  should be happy about,</span>
        <span id="hix01186s7" class="sentence"> like the fact that Father and Mother seemed cheerful all the  time now and Mother didn’t have to take as many of her afternoon naps or medicinal  sherries.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="Page_177" class="page-normal">
        <a href="s022.smil#Page_177">177</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01187" class="sentence"> And Gretel was going through a phase – Mother’s words – and tended to keep out of  his way.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01188" class="sentence"> There was also the fact that Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred away from Out-With  and wasn’t around to make Bruno feel angry and upset all the time.</span>
        <span id="hix01188s2" class="sentence"> (His departure  had come about very suddenly and there had been a lot of shouting between Father and  Mother about it late at night,</span>
        <span id="hix01188s3" class="sentence"> but he was gone,</span>
        <span id="hix01188s4" class="sentence"> that was for sure,</span>
        <span id="hix01188s5" class="sentence"> and he wasn’t coming  back; Gretel was inconsolable.) That was something else to be happy about: no one  called him ‘little man’ any more.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01189" class="sentence"> But the best thing was that he had a friend called Shmuel.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01190" class="sentence"> He enjoyed walking along the fence every afternoon and was pleased to see that his  friend seemed a lot happier these days and his eyes didn’t seem so sunken,</span>
        <span id="hix01190s2" class="sentence"> although  his body was still ridiculously skinny and his face unpleasantly grey.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01191" class="sentence"> One day,</span>
        <span id="hix01191s2" class="sentence"> while sitting opposite him at their usual place,</span>
        <span id="hix01191s3" class="sentence"> Bruno remarked,</span>
        <span id="hix01191s4" class="sentence"> ‘This is  the strangest friendship I’ve ever had.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01192" class="sentence"> ‘Why?’ asked Shmuel.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01193" class="sentence"> ‘Because every other boy I’ve ever been friends with has been someone that I’ve been  able to play with,’ he replied.</span>
        <span id="hix01193s2" class="sentence"> ‘And we never get to play together.</span>

        <a href="s022.smil#Page_178">178</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01194" class="sentence"> All we get to do is sit here and talk.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01195" class="sentence"> 'I like sitting here and talking,’ said Shmuel.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01196" class="sentence"> ‘Well,</span>
        <span id="hix01196s2" class="sentence"> I do too of course,’ said Bruno.</span>
        <span id="hix01196s3" class="sentence"> ‘But it’s a pity we can’t do something more  exciting from time to time.</span>
        <span id="hix01196s4" class="sentence"> A bit of exploring,</span>
        <span id="hix01196s5" class="sentence"> perhaps.</span>
        <span id="hix01196s6" class="sentence"> Or a game of football.</span>
        <span id="hix01196s7" class="sentence"> We’ve  never even seen each other without all this wire fencing in the way.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01197" class="sentence"> Bruno often made comments like this because he wanted to pretend that the incident  a few months earlier when he had denied his friendship with Shmuel had never taken  place.</span>
        <span id="hix01197s2" class="sentence"> It still preyed on his mind and made him feel bad about himself,</span>
        <span id="hix01197s3" class="sentence"> although Shmuel,</span>
        <span id="hix01197s4" class="sentence"> to his credit,</span>
        <span id="hix01197s5" class="sentence"> seemed to have forgotten all about it.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01198" class="sentence"> ‘Maybe someday we will,’ said Shmuel.</span>
        <span id="hix01198s2" class="sentence"> ‘If they ever let us out.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01199" class="sentence"> Bruno started to think more and more about the two sides of the fence and the reason  it was there in the first place.</span>
        <span id="hix01199s2" class="sentence"> He considered speaking to Father or Mother about  it but suspected that they would either be angry with him for mentioning it or tell  him something unpleasant about Shmuel and his family,</span>
        <span id="hix01199s3" class="sentence"> so instead he did something  quite unusual.</span>
        <span id="hix01199s4" class="sentence"> He decided to talk to the Hopeless Case.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01200" class="sentence"> Gretel’s room had changed quite considerably since the last time he had been there.</span>
        <span id="hix01200s2" class="sentence"> For one thing there wasn’t a single doll in sight.</span>
        <span id="hix01200s3" class="sentence"> One afternoon a month or so earlier,</span>
        <span id="hix01200s4" class="sentence"> around the time that Lieutenant Kotler had left Out-With,</span>
        <span id="hix01200s5" class="sentence"> Gretel had decided that  she didn’t like dolls any more and had put them all into four large bags and thrown  them away.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01201" class="sentence"> In their place she had hung up maps of Europe that Father had given her,</span>
        <span id="hix01201s2" class="sentence"> and every  day she put little pins into them and moved the pins around constantly after consulting  the daily newspaper.</span>
        <span id="hix01201s3" class="sentence"> Bruno thought she might be going mad.</span>
        <span id="hix01201s4" class="sentence"> But still,</span>
        <span id="hix01201s5" class="sentence"> she didn’t tease  him or bully him as much as she used to,</span>
        <span id="hix01201s6" class="sentence"> so he thought there could be no harm in talking  to her.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01202" class="sentence"> ‘Hello,’ he said,</span>
        <span id="hix01202s2" class="sentence"> knocking politely on her door because he knew how angry she always  got if he just went in.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01203" class="sentence"> ‘What do you want?’ asked Gretel,</span>
        <span id="hix01203s2" class="sentence"> who was sitting at her dressing table,</span>
        <span id="hix01203s3" class="sentence"> experimenting  with her hair.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01204" class="sentence"> ‘Nothing,’ said Bruno.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01205" class="sentence"> ‘Then go away.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01206" class="sentence"> Bruno nodded but came inside anyway and sat down on the side of the bed.</span>
        <span id="hix01206s2" class="sentence"> Gretel watched  him from out of the side of her eyes but didn’t say anything.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01207" class="sentence"> ‘Gretel,’ he said finally,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01208" class="sentence"> ‘If you make it quick,’ she said.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01209" class="sentence"> ‘Everything here at Out-With–’ he began,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01210" class="sentence"> ‘It’s not called Out-With,</span>
        <span id="hix01210s2" class="sentence"> Bruno,’ she said angrily,</span>
        <span id="hix01210s3" class="sentence"> as if this was the worst mistake  anyone had ever made in the history of the world.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01216" class="sentence"> ‘I want to know about the fence,’ he said firmly,</span>

        <span id="hix01216s3" class="sentence"> ‘I want to know why it’s there.’</span>

      <p>

        <span id="hix01360s4" class="sentence"> it was only the morning and a lot could happen between then and the late afternoon,</span>

        <span id="hix01362s3" class="sentence"> He watched  during history and geography lessons in the afternoon,</span>
        <span id="hix01362s4" class="sentence"> when it reached its strongest  force yet and threatened to knock the window in.</span>

      </p>
      <p>

        <span id="hix01364s3" class="sentence"> but he never did and managed to keep his balance,</span>
        <span id="hix01364s4" class="sentence"> even at a particularly bad  part where,</span>

        <span id="hix01375" class="sentence"> Shmuel lifted the bottom of the fence off the ground and handed the outfit underneath  to Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01375s2" class="sentence"> being particularly careful not to let it touch the muddy ground below.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01376" class="sentence"> ‘Thanks,’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01376s2" class="sentence"> scratching his stubbly head and wondering why he hadn’t remembered  to bring a bag to hold his own clothes in.</span>
        <span id="hix01376s3" class="sentence"> The ground was so dirty here that they  would be spoiled if he left them on the ground.</span>
        <span id="hix01376s4" class="sentence"> He didn’t have a choice really.</span>
        <span id="hix01376s5" class="sentence"> He  could either leave them here until later and accept the fact that they would be entirely  caked with mud; or he could call the whole thing off and that,</span>
        <span id="hix01376s6" class="sentence"> as any explorer of  note knows,</span>
        <span id="hix01376s7" class="sentence"> would have been out of the question.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01377" class="sentence"> ‘Well,</span>
        <span id="hix01377s2" class="sentence"> turn round,’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01377s3" class="sentence"> pointing at his friend as he stood there awkwardly.</span>
        <span id="hix01377s4" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t want you watching me.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01378" class="sentence"> Shmuel turned round and Bruno took off his overcoat and placed it as gently as possible  on the ground.</span>
        <span id="hix01378s2" class="sentence"> Then he took off his shirt and shivered for a moment in the cold air  before putting on the pyjama top.</span>
        <span id="hix01378s3" class="sentence"> As it slipped over his head he made the mistake  of breathing through his nose; it did not smell very nice.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01379" class="sentence"> ‘When was this last washed?’ he called out,</span>
        <span id="hix01379s2" class="sentence"> and Shmuel turned round.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01380" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t know if it’s ever been washed,’ said Shmuel.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01381" class="sentence"> ‘Turn round!’ shouted Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01381s2" class="sentence"> and Shmuel did as he was told.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01382" class="sentence"> Bruno looked left and right again but there was still no one to be seen,</span>
        <span id="hix01382s2" class="sentence"> so he began  the difficult task of taking off his trousers while keeping one leg and one boot on  the ground at the same time.</span>
        <span id="hix01382s3" class="sentence"> It felt very strange taking off his trousers in the open  air and he couldn’t imagine what anyone would think if they saw him doing it,</span>
        <span id="hix01382s4" class="sentence"> but  finally,</span>
        <span id="hix01382s5" class="sentence"> and with a great deal of effort,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01383" class="sentence"> ‘There,’ he said.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01384" class="sentence"> Shmuel turned just as Bruno applied the finishing touch to his costume,</span>
        <span id="hix01384s2" class="sentence"> placing the  striped cloth cap on his head.</span>
        <span id="hix01384s3" class="sentence"> Shmuel blinked and shook his head.</span>
        <span id="hix01384s4" class="sentence"> It was quite extraordinary.</span>
        <span id="hix01384s5" class="sentence"> If it wasn’t for the fact that Bruno was nowhere near as skinny as the boys on his  side of the fence,</span>
        <span id="hix01384s6" class="sentence"> and not quite so pale either,</span>
        <span id="hix01384s7" class="sentence"> it would have been difficult to tell  them apart.</span>
        <span id="hix01384s8" class="sentence"> It was almost (Shmuel thought) as if they were all exactly the same really.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01385" class="sentence"> ‘Do you know what this reminds me of?’ asked Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01385s2" class="sentence"> and Shmuel shook his head.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01386" class="sentence"> ‘What?’ he asked.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01387" class="sentence"> ‘It reminds me of Grandmother,’ he said.</span>
        <span id="hix01387s2" class="sentence"> ‘You remember I told you about her?</span>
        <span id="hix01387s3" class="sentence"> The one  who died?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01388" class="sentence"> Shmuel nodded; he remembered because Bruno had talked about her a lot over the course  of the year and had told him how fond he had been of Grandmother and how he wished  he’d taken the time to write more letters to her before she passed away.</span>

        <span id="hix01389s4" class="sentence"> ‘It reminds me of how she always had the right  costume for me to wear.</span>

        <span id="hix01390" class="sentence"> ‘A Jew,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01391" class="sentence"> ‘Yes,’ said Bruno,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01392" class="sentence"> Shmuel pointed at Bruno’s feet and the heavy boots he had taken from the house.</span>

        <span id="hix01393s2" class="sentence"> ‘But the mud,’ he said.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01394" class="sentence"> ‘You’ll be recognized otherwise,’ said Shmuel.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01395" class="sentence"> Bruno sighed but he knew that his friend was right,</span>
        <span id="hix01395s2" class="sentence"> and he took off the boots and  his socks and left them beside the pile of clothes on the ground.</span>
        <span id="hix01395s3" class="sentence"> At first it felt  horrible putting his bare feet into so much mud; they sank down to his ankles and  every time he lifted a foot it felt worse.</span>
        <span id="hix01395s4" class="sentence"> But then he started to rather enjoy it.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01396" class="sentence"> Shmuel reached down and lifted the base of the fence,</span>
        <span id="hix01396s2" class="sentence"> but it only lifted to a certain  height and Bruno had no choice but to roll under it,</span>
        <span id="hix01396s3" class="sentence"> getting his striped pyjamas completely  covered in mud as he did so.</span>
        <span id="hix01396s4" class="sentence"> He laughed when he looked down at himself.</span>
        <span id="hix01396s5" class="sentence"> He had never  been so filthy in all his life and it felt wonderful.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01397" class="sentence"> Shmuel smiled too and the two boys stood awkwardly together for a moment,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01398" class="sentence"> Bruno had an urge to give Shmuel a hug,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01399" class="sentence"> Shmuel had an urge to give Bruno a hug too,</span>

        <span id="hix01400" class="sentence"> Neither of them did hug each other though,</span>

        <span id="hix01400s3" class="sentence"> a walk that Shmuel had done almost every day for a  year now,</span>
        <span id="hix01400s4" class="sentence"> when he had escaped the eyes of the soldiers and managed to get to that  one part of Out-With that didn’t seem to be guarded all the time,</span>

        <span id="hix01401s3" class="sentence"> In his imagination he had thought that all the huts were full  of happy families,</span>
        <span id="hix01401s4" class="sentence"> some of whom sat outside on rocking chairs in the evening and told  stories about how things were so much better when they were children and they’d had  respect for their elders,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01402" class="sentence"> He thought that all the boys and girls who lived here would be in different groups,</span>
        <span id="hix01402s2" class="sentence"> playing tennis or football,</span>
        <span id="hix01402s3" class="sentence"> skipping and drawing out squares for hopscotch on the  ground.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01403" class="sentence"> He had thought that there would be a shop in the centre,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01404" class="sentence"> As it turned out,</span>
        <span id="hix01404s2" class="sentence"> all the things that he thought might be there – weren’t.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01405" class="sentence"> There were no grown-ups sitting on rocking chairs</span>

        <span id="hix01406" class="sentence"> on their porches.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01407" class="sentence"> And the children weren’t playing games in groups.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01408" class="sentence"> And not only was there not a fruit and vegetable stall,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01409" class="sentence"> Instead there were crowds of people sitting together in groups,</span>
        <span id="hix01409s2" class="sentence"> staring at the ground,</span>
        <span id="hix01409s3" class="sentence"> looking horribly sad; they all had one thing in common: they were all terribly skinny  and their eyes were sunken and they all had shaved heads,</span>
        <span id="hix01409s4" class="sentence"> which Bruno thought must  have meant there had been an outbreak of lice here too.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01410" class="sentence"> In one corner Bruno could see three soldiers who seemed to be in charge of a group  of about twenty men.</span>
        <span id="hix01410s2" class="sentence"> They were shouting at them,</span>
        <span id="hix01410s3" class="sentence"> and some of the men had fallen to  their knees and were remaining there with their heads in their hands.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01411" class="sentence"> In another corner he could see more soldiers standing around and laughing and looking  down the barrels of their guns,</span>
        <span id="hix01411s2" class="sentence"> aiming them in random directions,</span>
        <span id="hix01411s3" class="sentence"> but not firing them.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01412" class="sentence"> In fact everywhere he looked,</span>
        <span id="hix01412s2" class="sentence"> all he could see was two different types of people:  either happy,</span>
        <span id="hix01412s3" class="sentence"> laughing,</span>
        <span id="hix01412s4" class="sentence"> shouting soldiers in their uniforms or unhappy,</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01413" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t think I like it here,’ said Bruno after a while.</span>

        <span id="hix01416" class="sentence"> Shmuel stopped walking and stared at him.</span>
        <span id="hix01416s2" class="sentence"> ‘But Papa,’ he said.</span>
        <span id="hix01416s3" class="sentence"> ‘You said you’d help  me find him.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01417" class="sentence"> Bruno thought about it.</span>
        <span id="hix01417s2" class="sentence"> He had promised his friend that and he wasn’t the sort to  go back on a promise,</span>
        <span id="hix01417s3" class="sentence"> especially when it was the last time they were going to see  each other.</span>
        <span id="hix01417s4" class="sentence"> ‘All right,’ he said,</span>
        <span id="hix01417s5" class="sentence"> although he felt a lot less confident now than he  had before.</span>
        <span id="hix01417s6" class="sentence"> ‘But where should we look?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01418" class="sentence"> ‘You said we’d need to find evidence,’ said Shmuel,</span>
        <span id="hix01418s2" class="sentence"> who was feeling upset because  he thought that if Bruno didn’t help him,</span>
        <span id="hix01418s3" class="sentence"> then who would?</span>

        <span id="hix01419" class="sentence"> ‘Evidence,</span>
        <span id="hix01419s2" class="sentence"> yes,’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01419s3" class="sentence"> nodding his head.</span>
        <span id="hix01419s4" class="sentence"> ‘You’re right.</span>
        <span id="hix01419s5" class="sentence"> Let’s start looking.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01420" class="sentence"> So Bruno kept his word and the two boys spent an hour and a half searching the camp  looking for evidence.</span>
        <span id="hix01420s2" class="sentence"> They weren’t sure exactly what they were looking for,</span>
        <span id="hix01420s3" class="sentence"> but Bruno  kept stating that a good explorer would know it when he found it.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01421" class="sentence"> But they didn’t find anything at all that might give them a clue to Shmuel’s papa’s  disappearance,</span>
        <span id="hix01421s2" class="sentence"> and it started to get darker.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01422" class="sentence"> Bruno looked up at the sky and it looked like it might rain again.</span>
        <span id="hix01422s2" class="sentence"> ‘I'm sorry,</span>
        <span id="hix01422s3" class="sentence"> Shmuel,’  he said eventually.</span>
        <span id="hix01422s4" class="sentence"> ‘I'm sorry we didn’t find any evidence.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01423" class="sentence"> Shmuel nodded his head sadly.</span>
        <span id="hix01423s2" class="sentence"> He wasn’t really surprised.</span>
        <span id="hix01423s3" class="sentence"> He hadn’t really expected  to.</span>
        <span id="hix01423s4" class="sentence"> But it had been nice having his friend over to see where he lived all the same.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01424" class="sentence"> ‘I think I ought to go home now,’ said Bruno.</span>
        <span id="hix01424s2" class="sentence"> ‘Will you walk back to the fence with  me?’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01425" class="sentence"> Shmuel opened his mouth to answer,</span>
        <span id="hix01425s2" class="sentence"> but right at that moment there was a loud whistle  and ten soldiers – more than Bruno had ever seen gathered together in one place before  – surrounded an area of the camp,</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01426" class="sentence"> ‘What’s happening?’ whispered Bruno.</span>

        <span id="hix01427" class="sentence"> ‘It happens sometimes,’ said Shmuel.</span>
        <span id="hix01427s2" class="sentence"> ‘They make people go on marches.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01428" class="sentence"> Marches!’ said Bruno,</span>
        <span id="hix01428s2" class="sentence"> appalled.</span>
        <span id="hix01428s3" class="sentence"> ‘I can’t go on a march.</span>
        <span id="hix01428s4" class="sentence"> I have to be home in time  for dinner.</span>
        <span id="hix01428s5" class="sentence"> It’s roast beef tonight.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01429" class="sentence"> ‘Ssh,’ said Shmuel,</span>
        <span id="hix01429s2" class="sentence"> putting a finger to his lips.</span>
        <span id="hix01429s3" class="sentence"> ‘Don’t say anything or they get  angry.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01430" class="sentence"> Bruno frowned but was relieved that all the people in striped pyjamas from this part  of the camp were gathering together now,</span>
        <span id="hix01430s2" class="sentence"> most of them being pushed together by the  soldiers,</span>
        <span id="hix01430s3" class="sentence"> so that he and Shmuel were hidden in the centre of them and couldn’t be  seen.</span>
        <span id="hix01430s4" class="sentence"> He didn't know what everyone looked so frightened about – after all,</span>
        <span id="hix01430s5" class="sentence"> marching  wasn’t such a terrible thing – and he wanted to whisper to them that everything was  all right,</span>
        <span id="hix01430s6" class="sentence"> that Father was the Commandant,</span>
        <span id="hix01430s7" class="sentence"> and if this was the kind of thing that  he wanted the people to do then it must be all right.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01431" class="sentence"> The whistles blew again,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s2" class="sentence"> and this time the group of people,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s3" class="sentence"> which must have numbered  about a hundred,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s4" class="sentence"> started to march slowly together,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s5" class="sentence"> with Bruno and Shmuel still held  together in the centre.</span>
        <span id="hix01431s6" class="sentence"> There was some sort of disturbance towards the back,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s7" class="sentence"> where  some people seemed unwilling to march,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s8" class="sentence"> but Bruno was too small to see what happened  and all he heard was loud noises,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s9" class="sentence"> like the sound of gunshots,</span>
        <span id="hix01431s10" class="sentence"> but he couldn’t make  out what they were.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01432" class="sentence"> ‘Does the marching go on for long?’ he whispered because he was beginning to feel  quite hungry now.</span>

      <p>
        <span id="hix01433" class="sentence"> ‘I don’t think so,’ said Shmuel.</span>
        <span id="hix01433s2" class="sentence"> 'I never see the people after they’ve gone on a march.</span>
        <span id="hix01433s3" class="sentence"> But I wouldn’t imagine it does.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01434" class="sentence"> Bruno frowned.</span>
        <span id="hix01434s2" class="sentence"> He looked up at the sky,</span>
        <span id="hix01434s3" class="sentence"> and as he did so there was another loud sound,</span>
        <span id="hix01434s4" class="sentence"> this time the sound of thunder overhead,</span>
        <span id="hix01434s5" class="sentence"> and just as quickly the sky seemed to grow  even darker,</span>
        <span id="hix01434s6" class="sentence"> almost black,</span>
        <span id="hix01434s7" class="sentence"> and rain poured down even more heavily than it had in the  morning.</span>
        <span id="hix01434s8" class="sentence"> Bruno closed his eyes for a moment and felt it wash over him.</span>
        <span id="hix01434s9" class="sentence"> When he opened  them again he wasn’t so much marching as being swept along by the group of people,</span>
        <span id="hix01434s10" class="sentence"> and all he could feel was the mud that was caked all over his body and his pyjamas  clinging to his skin with all the rain and he longed to be back in his house,</span>
        <span id="hix01434s11" class="sentence"> watching  all this from a distance and not wrapped up in the centre of it.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01435" class="sentence"> ‘That’s it,’ he said to Shmuel.</span>
        <span id="hix01435s2" class="sentence"> ‘I’m going to catch a cold out here.</span>
        <span id="hix01435s3" class="sentence"> I have to go  home.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01436" class="sentence"> But just as he said this,</span>
        <span id="hix01436s2" class="sentence"> his feet brought him up a set of steps,</span>
        <span id="hix01436s3" class="sentence"> and as he marched  on he found there was no more rain coming down any more because they were all piling  into a long room that was surprisingly warm and must have been very securely built  because no rain was getting in anywhere.</span>
        <span id="hix01436s4" class="sentence"> In fact it felt completely airtight.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01437" class="sentence"> ‘Well,</span>
        <span id="hix01437s2" class="sentence"> that’s something,’ he said,</span>
        <span id="hix01437s3" class="sentence"> glad to be out of the storm for a few minutes at  least.</span>
        <span id="hix01437s4" class="sentence"> ‘I expect we’ll have to wait here till it eases off and then I’ll get to go  home.’</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01438" class="sentence"> Shmuel gathered himself very close to Bruno and looked up at him in fright.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01439" class="sentence"> ‘I’m sorry we didn’t find your papa,’ said Bruno.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01440" class="sentence"> ‘It’s all right,’ said Shmuel.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01441" class="sentence"> ‘And I’m sorry we didn’t really get to play,</span>
        <span id="hix01441s2" class="sentence"> but when you come to Berlin,</span>
        <span id="hix01441s3" class="sentence"> that’s what  we’ll do.</span>
        <span id="hix01441s4" class="sentence"> And I’ll introduce you to...</span>
        <span id="hix01441s5" class="sentence"> Oh,</span>
        <span id="hix01441s6" class="sentence"> what were their names again?’ he asked  himself,</span>
        <span id="hix01441s7" class="sentence"> frustrated because they were supposed to be his three best friends for life  but they had all vanished from his memory now.</span>
        <span id="hix01441s8" class="sentence"> He couldn’t remember any of their names  and he couldn’t picture any of their faces.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01442" class="sentence"> ‘Actually,’ he said,</span>
        <span id="hix01442s2" class="sentence"> looking down at Shmuel,</span>
        <span id="hix01442s3" class="sentence"> ‘it doesn’t matter whether I do or don’t.</span>
        <span id="hix01442s4" class="sentence"> They’re not my best friends any more anyway.’ He looked down and did something quite  out of character for him: he took hold of Shmuel’s tiny hand in his and squeezed it  tightly.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01443" class="sentence"> ‘You’re my best friend,</span>
        <span id="hix01443s2" class="sentence"> Shmuel,’ he said.</span>
        <span id="hix01443s3" class="sentence"> ‘My best friend for life.’</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01444" class="sentence"> Shmuel may well have opened his mouth to say something back,</span>
        <span id="hix01444s2" class="sentence"> but Bruno never heard  it because at that moment there was a loud gasp from all the marchers who had filled  the room,</span>
        <span id="hix01444s3" class="sentence"> as the door at the front was suddenly closed and a loud metallic sound rang  through from the outside.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01445" class="sentence"> Bruno raised an eyebrow,</span>
        <span id="hix01445s2" class="sentence"> unable to understand the sense of all this,</span>
        <span id="hix01445s3" class="sentence"> but he assumed  that it had something to do with keeping the rain out and stopping people from catching  colds.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="hix01446" class="sentence"> And then the room went very dark and somehow,</span>
        <span id="hix01446s2" class="sentence"> despite the chaos that followed,</span>
        <span id="hix01446s3" class="sentence"> Bruno  found that he was still holding Shmuel’s hand in his own and nothing in the world  would have persuaded him to let it go.</span>

        <span id="hix01452s3" class="sentence"> He went to sleep every night  thinking about Bruno and he woke up every morning thinking about him too.</span>
        <span id="hix01452s4" class="sentence"> One day  he formed a theory about what might have occurred and he went back to the place in  the fence where the pile of clothes had been found a year before.</span>

        <span class="sentence">
          <span id="hix01453" class="sentence">  There was nothing particularly special about this place,</span>

        <span id="hix01453s2" class="sentence"> or different,</span>
        <span id="hix01453s3" class="sentence"> but then he  did a little exploration of his own and discovered that the base of the fence here  was not properly attached to the ground as it was everywhere else and that,</span>
        <span id="hix01453s4" class="sentence"> when lifted,</span>
        <span id="hix01453s5" class="sentence"> it left a gap large enough for a very small person (such as a little boy) to crawl  underneath.</span>
        <span id="hix01453s6" class="sentence"> He looked into the distance then and followed it through logically,</span>
        <span id="hix01453s7" class="sentence"> step  by step by step,</span>
        <span id="hix01453s8" class="sentence"> and when he did he found that his legs seemed to stop working right  – as if they couldn’t hold his body up any longer – and he ended up sitting on the  ground in almost exactly the same position as Bruno had every afternoon for a year,</span>
